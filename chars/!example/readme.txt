This is the example character template for Freakloader!

By default, the folder name has an exclamation mark at the start to exclude it from being loaded, but you're free to take it out if you wish to play as Example (for some reason).

Sprite offsets are done automatically, and while you're free to use sprites bigger or smaller than the ones used for Example, it might be in your best interest to stick close to the original sizes.

Have fun!
